## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

This is an Iron Maiden fan website created for an HTML/CSS exercise during my time in coding bootcamp. I created it from scratch based on the requirements of the assignment. I am actively adding to this website as I learn.

### Continued development

I plan to continue improving this website with responsive design for mobile/tablet/desktop as well as adding some features using JavaScript.
